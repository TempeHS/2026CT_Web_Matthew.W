    <p>This plushie is super soft and squishy. It also can become alive! If you buy the overseer plushie and give broker you social security number, credit card details and IP, broker will turn from plushie, to a walking talking thingy (Yay!) Broker's premium features include : work a 9-10 hour job, run an even bigger shady buisness and also be able to eliminate all haters with the help of daddy overseer (yipee!) This is perfect for children with really REALLY bad anger issues so they can take their stress out on other people! (Wowee!) Side note : the plushie costs $30 but the shipping is quite expensive! This is because trying to get a shrunken down human on the plane is quite hard (thats crazy!) anyways, shipping is 800k cough it up brokie (this is actually quite worth it because you practically have a human sized god) </p>
